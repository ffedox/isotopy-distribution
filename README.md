# Identifying medical drama narratives: a multi-output regression approach with CNNs and BERT

This repository contains the final project for the 2022-23 edition of the [Natural Language Processing](https://albarron.github.io/teaching/natural-language-processing/) course. The aim of the project was to predict the distribution of three plot types that are characteristic of the medical drama genre. To address this task, three text regression models were developed.

More information about the creation of the corpus can be found [here](https://github.com/TinfFoil/dar_tvseries).
