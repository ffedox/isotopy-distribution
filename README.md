# Identifying medical drama narratives: a multi-output regression approach with CNNs and BERT

This repository contains the final project for the 2022-23 edition of the [Natural Language Processing](https://albarron.github.io/teaching/natural-language-processing/) course. The corpus used in the project was obtained by aligning subtitles with the dataset described in [Rocchi and Pescatore (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01352-9), which contains video segments labeled with weights ranging from 0 to 6, representing the distribution of three different narratives typical of the medical drama genre. To address this task, three text regression models were developed.
