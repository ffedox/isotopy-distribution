# Distribution learning

Label distribution learning involves modeling the probability distribution of a target variable, rather than just predicting a single value. This is achieved by using a sigmoid activation after a linear layer to predict multiple outputs. Instead of discretizing the output of the sigmoid function into binary classes, the outputs are kept as continuous values between 0 and 1.
